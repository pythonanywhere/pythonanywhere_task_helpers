I want to start learning Python
===============================

Up here you will see instructions that will walk you through the basic use of
PythonAnywhere and some very basic Python programming to get you started.

You can go forward and back through the steps using the
arrow buttons below, and you can finish at any time by clicking the cross in
the top right.  If after closing this helper, you want to go through it again
--- or try another one -- go to the **Help** page, by following
the link above and to the right.

Click the right arrow when you're ready.

----


This page is your **Dashboard**.  It has an overview of all your stuff on
PythonAnywhere, but you can also access more functionality via the
individual links named "Consoles","Files", and so on, above.  We'll have
a look at the most important ones shortly.

You can get to the Dashboard from anywhere you are in PythonAnywhere
by clicking the PythonAnywhere logo in the top left.

----

Click on the ">>> Python" button in the "New console" section below (underneath
the Recent Consoles section), then on the **3.6** button in the menu that
appears; this will start Python version 3.6, which is a good version to start
off with. After a little while, you should see a console with a "prompt" that
looks like this:

    >>>

This is the standard Python "interactive interpreter". It's also sometimes called
the REPL (which stands for Read, Evaluate and Print Loop), or a CLI (Command
Line Interpreter). Here you can enter
Python and it will be run immediately.  Let's try that in the next step.

----

Try typing `print("Hello, world")` and hitting Enter. Your console should now
look like this

    >>> print("Hello, world")
    Hello, world
    >>>

So, you told Python to print out the message "Hello, world", and it did so
straight away.

----

Now that you know how to start a Python interpreter, you might be wondering how
you can write programs that are more permanent than the lines you typed into
the interpreter.

For that, we need to learn about files on PythonAnywhere.

Return to your **Dashboard** by clicking the PythonAnywhere logo at the top left.

----

To create a more permanent program, we'll need to create a file to hold it.
Click on the **Files** link above and to the right.

You are now looking at your home directory on PythonAnywhere.

To create a Python file, type `helloworld.py` into the text box that says
`Enter new file name` then click the **New file** button next to it.

----

The code editor will open up.  This is where you can enter programs
that will be saved in files. Type this into it:

    print("Hello, world. Again")

Click ">>> Run" at the top right to save and run your program.  A console should appear
beneath the editor, running your code.  Now  you can make changes, and hit
"Run" again at any time to see what happened.

----

We've now walked you through the very basics of using PythonAnywhere to learn
Python. There are a number of extremely good tutorials on the web and you
should now be able to follow them on PythonAnywhere. Here are some of our favorites:

 * [The Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) (You can skip sections 1 and 2)
 * [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

There is also [a big list of python tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) on the Python wiki.

Good luck on your journey into the world of Python!
